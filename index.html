                            <h2>Description</h2>
                            <p>In this project, my goal is to apply everything I've learned about HTML and CSS
                                throughout
                                this
                                course. I'm required to create a fully functional and responsive website based on
                                the
                                assignment
                                brief I chose.</p>
                            <p>The website must incorporate all the pages outlined in the site architecture of my
                                chosen
                                brief.
                                I'll ensure that the site mimics certain JavaScript functionalities, like linking
                                from a
                                'add to
                                cart' button to a cart.</p>
                            <p>My focus will be on writing semantic and neat HTML. The CSS I use will adhere to the
                                DRY
                                (Don't
                                Repeat Yourself) principle and be easy to read. I understand the importance of
                                responsiveness
                                and will ensure the website looks good on all screen sizes without horizontal
                                scrollbars.
                                I'll
                                utilize Flexbox and CSS Grids and avoid using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap. My
                                website
                                will
                                be
                                WCAG compliant, with a strong emphasis on accessibility.</p>
                            <p>Each page of my website will have a unique , title, and h1</p>

                            <p>In this project, I am tasked with developing a website for the Community Science Museum,
                                which
                                targets middle school children and families with young children. My goal is to create a
                                website
                                that is both informative and engaging, designed to appeal to the curiosity and
                                intelligence
                                of
                                young minds, encouraging them and their families to visit the museum</p>
                            <p>My responsibilities include effectively using provided media assets in my design, paying
                                close
                                attention to the target audience's preferences in layout, color schemes, and typography.
                                The
                                website will consist of 4-6 pages, and I will ensure it is optimized for fast loading,
                                with
                                images not exceeding 200kb, and is accessible in compliance with WCAG standards.</p>
                            <p>This project requires me to demonstrate a high level of technical proficiency in HTML and
                                CSS. I
                                will focus on creating semantically structured HTML and CSS that adheres to the DRY
                                (Don't
                                Repeat Yourself) principle. Additionally, the website must be responsive, providing a
                                smooth
                                user experience across various devices.</p>
                            <p>For the submission, I will provide a live version of the site, a prototype, a link to my
                                GitHub
                                repository containing the project code, and a comprehensive report. This report will
                                discuss
                                the
                                design and technical aspects of my project, my adherence to WCAG guidelines, SEO

                                content handling. I am aware that the project duration is set at four weeks for

                            <h2>Description</h2>
                            <p>In my Project Exam 1, I'm taking on the challenge of creating a blog site, leveraging the
                                skills I've learned during my first year of studies. This project allows me the freedom
                                to decide on the design and topics of the blog, but it must include several key pages: a
                                Home page, an About page, a page listing all blog posts, individual blog post pages, and
                                a Contact page.
                            </p>
                            <p>For the Home page, I'm planning to feature a 'Latest Posts' section. This will be in the
                                form of a carousel for desktop viewers, showcasing a set number of posts at a time, with
                                navigational arrows to scroll through.</p>
                            <p>The blog posts page will initially show the first 10 blogs, with an option for users to
                                view more. Each specific blog post page will be dynamically created based on the user's
                                selection, with a changing title to reflect the chosen blog post. Additionally, I'll
                                include a feature where clicking on images opens a modal for an enlarged view.</p>
                            <p>The Contact page will have textboxes for name, email, subject, and message content, all
                                validated using JavaScript to ensure accuracy and relevance.</p>
                            <p>A unique aspect of this project is the use of WordPress as a Headless CMS. I'll be using
                                it solely to provide an API and add content for the blog. My task is to build the
                                website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making API calls to WordPress for content. I'm
                                expected to add at least 12 blog posts on WordPress, which can include lorem ipsum text,
                                but should have sensible headings and images.</p>
                            <p>My process involves deciding on the blog theme, creating a website prototype, setting up
                                WordPress, and developing the site using the specified technologies. I will also install
                                Hotjar for user testing, and make adjustments based on the feedback and insights
                                gathered.
                            </p>
                            <p>The final deliverables will be a comprehensive report documenting the project, submitted
                                as a PDF, along with links to both the live site on Netlify and the GitHub repository. I
                                also have the option to enhance the blog with additional features like sorting,
                                filtering, and enabling user comments, which would be posted back to WordPress. This is
                                a significant task, as tutor support is limited, emphasizing the exam nature of this
                                project.</p>
